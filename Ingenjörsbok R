Where I have coded I have used a lot of code, but I have learned more by coding for projects such as where I have written (input).
So where the program asks the customer if they want to order and then they can answer with yes/no.
Now I have grasped more about configuration management as how much it is important when you have projected
e.g. onfiguration management means to identify all document and be able to control components and versions of a product or system It can be as software, documentation or hardware.
We use configuration management to make changes to systems or be able to track changes, and it makes it easier to understand their impact. 2029-09-20
